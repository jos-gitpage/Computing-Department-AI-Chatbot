Here's a 2-Month Roadmap for the  AI-Based Communication Assistant, incorporating the suggested improvements:

     AI-Based Communication Assistant Roadmap (2 Months)
       Week 1: Research & Planning
1.  Define project scope and requirements.
2.  Identify primary data sources (department website, FAQs, announcements, emails, student portals).
3.  Research NLP and Speech-to-Text models (GPT, Whisper AI, BERT, etc.).
4.  Design UI/UX for chatbot interface (text + voice input).
5.  Establish security and authentication requirements.

        Week 2-3: AI Model Development
1.  Implement Speech-to-Text conversion using Google Speech-to-Text API or Whisper AI.
2. Develop NLP-based query processing (train model to extract relevant responses).
3.  Integrate web scraping (BeautifulSoup/Scrapy) to fetch website/FAQ data.
4.  Connect to departmentâ€™s real-time announcement system (if applicable).
5.  Implement database (PostgreSQL/Firebase/MySQL) for storing queries and responses.

        Week 4-5: System Integration
1.  Build backend using Flask/Django/Node.js.
2.  Develop API endpoints for querying the AI model.
3.  Integrate frontend with React (chatbot interface).
4.  Implement authentication (OAuth or student portal integration).
5.  Optimize query processing speed & response accuracy.

        Week 6: Security & Privacy Implementation
1.  Ensure data privacy measures (no sensitive academic data exposure).
2.  Implement encryption & authentication for user queries.
3.  Perform penetration testing and access control validation.
4.  Secure API endpoints from unauthorized access.

          Week 7: Testing & Optimization
1.  Conduct user testing with students and faculty.
2.  Measure response accuracy and query resolution time.
3.  Optimize UI/UX based on feedback.
4.  Improve AI model to handle complex/multi-turn conversations.

        Week 8: Deployment & Evaluation
1.  Deploy on web & mobile platforms.
2.  Monitor system performance and user engagement.
3.  Gather final feedback and make necessary refinements.
4. Prepare a post-launch improvement plan.

       Expected Deliverables in 2 Months:
1. AI-powered chatbot for computing students (voice & text).
2.  Secure and privacy-compliant communication system.
3.  Integration with department website, FAQs, and student portal.
4.  Web & mobile-ready deployment with optimized user experience.
